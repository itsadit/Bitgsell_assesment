Hi,
Here's a summary of the changes and improvements I made across both the backend (Node.js) and frontend (React) as per the assessment requirements.

## Backend (Node.js)

1. Refactored Blocking I/O
Replaced all synchronous file operations (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync) with non-blocking async versions using fs.promises.

Updated items.js to use async/await throughout.

2. Performance Optimization – /api/stats
Introduced in-memory caching to avoid recomputing stats on every request.

Added a file watcher (fs.watchFile) to invalidate the cache when items.json changes.

3. Testing (Jest + Supertest)
Added unit/integration tests in __tests__/routes/items.routes.test.js.

Covered:

Happy paths (GET, POST)

Query filters

Error cases (invalid ID, bad payloads)

Configured test environment in package.json.

## Frontend (React)

1. Fixed Memory Leak in Items.js
Wrapped fetch logic with a cleanup flag (let active = true) inside useEffect to prevent setState after unmount.

2. Pagination & Server-Side Search
Passed limit and q query parameters to the backend from the frontend.

Backend filters results based on search text and applies pagination via ?limit=....

3. Virtualized List (Performance)
Integrated react-window (FixedSizeList) to handle large lists efficiently.

Items render smoothly without affecting UI performance.

4. UI/UX Enhancements
Added loading states (Loading items..., Loading item...)

Clear error messages on failed API fetch.

Accessible navigation with semantic HTML (<nav>, <ul>, <Link>).

## Folder Structure Created
backend/__tests__/routes/items.routes.test.js

frontend/src/pages/Items.js, ItemDetail.js — updated

frontend/src/state/DataContext.js — updated for fetchItems

frontend/package.json — added proxy to fix CORS

## How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
# Backend
cd test6/backend
npm install
npm start

# Frontend
cd test6/frontend
npm install
npm start

## Trade-Offs & Notes
In-memory cache in stats is basic — no expiration logic, just invalidation via fs.watchFile.

Pagination is limited to slicing; in a real system with DB, we'd do offset-based or cursor-based pagination.

Used Date.now() for ID generation in POST; in production, UUID would be safer.

Thank you for reviewing! Let me know if you’d like me to explain any part further.
